I find the same feeling that endorphin gives use whenever I tackle highly challenging issues and I can overcome it. There are moments when I wonder, &quot;Wow, back then you think this is impossible. But look at you now, it works!&quot;. Sometimes we meet with certain issues with our code, lack of documentation frameworks, deprecated libraries, compatibility issues, etc. There are only two choices, either give up trying or keep pushing forward. These issues might give me some goosebumps, am I able to deliver it on time or not? However, I tend to keep moving forward by exploring different approaches, and doing trial and error with multiple scenarios or solutions, and eventually, through perseverance and luck, I can overcome those challenges. Overcoming this kind of situation gives me a deep sense of pride and happiness, just like the satisfaction when you see your results after 3 months of working out.",
